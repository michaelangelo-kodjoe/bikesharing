## Overview of analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyse NYC Citi Bike Sharing data to be able to create a proposal for investors to support a similar bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. From the given dataset, These visualizations were created to see average biking durations trends and the relationships between gender and popular biking times that can be applied in the same area in Des Moines.

Manhattan is the central hub for citybike. This is because most businesses operate in this borough

### Usage by gender

### Usage by time of day

The heatmap indicates that the time that the service is being used the mosty is on Thursdays between the hours of  5pm and 6pm. There is also high usage from Monday to Thursday between that time.

### Chekout times

According to the graphs, it takes an average of 5 minutes for which people use bike-sharing. In the second graph, males tend to hit that 5 minute average than the other genders.

### Peak Times

The peak times for using CityBike is between 5pm to 7pm

### Different user types

From this graph, Males usually patronise the the bike sharing service the most. Another interesting key seen here is, majority of the men are subscribers to the service as opposed to just being people who just use the service as need be. For example, Tourists.

## Summary
Based on the analysis, it can be assumed that:
* Many of these users may not be tourists but rather work commuters, as most of the peak times are around morning and evening commute. 
* A majority of the users were male riders. Although this may not be anything significant, it may be useful for future marketing campaigns to mostly men.
* Another significant point that can be made is that most of the ride durations peaked in and around 5 minutes. If there were to be a bike-sharing program set up in Des Moines, it would help if each station could be set up within 8 to 10 minutes of biking distance from each other. This is because it needs to to be factored in that NYC is a large city, whereas Des Moines is mainly suburbs.

Two other suggestions for future analysis is to:
* Show the distance between citi bike points to know how far apart would be ideal to place the bike sharing service in Des Moines
* To show where the subscribers usually checkout their bikes to know how to put in more bikes in that area for higher revenue of the bike sharing service
